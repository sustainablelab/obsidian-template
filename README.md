The `.obsidian` folder in this repository is **my Obsidian
template**.

# About

I use Obsidian to decouple the task of generating documentation
from the task of organizing that documentation into a structure.
I created this template to quickly get my Obsidian settings into
a new project. I do not have one giant vault for all of my work.
I have separate vaults for each project (i.e., one vault per Git
repository).

To use the template, I simply copy the `.obsidian` folder into a
project (a Git repository). More details and explanation are
[here (click to open)](usage.md).
